                My first venture into Porsche restoration arrived out of the blue in about March 2015.

                I knew someone who owned a red 924 which needed a good deal of love and
                attention. He needed to sell it to finance the purchase of another car and
                wondered if I fancied buying it.<br/>The car was in a terrible state. Half
                the interior had been ripped out and the bodywork was terrible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without thinking twice, I discovered I had bought it.<br>I've always been
                a bit prone to making decisions without really thinking them through.!!
            </p>
            <p>
                I eventually managed to find the time to have a look at it and decide what
                the important jobs were. I figured that as half the
                electrics didn't work, I would try to trace some of those faults first.
                I started by stripping out the interior so that I would have better
                access to the wiring. Out came the seats and dashboard. It was at this
                moment that I got my next surprise. At some point in it's life the car
                had obviously suffered from a lot of rot and none of it had been fixed.
                The battery tray had rotted away and instead of cutting out all the dead
                tin and fixing it, somebody had just welded a plate in over the top.
                This was fine for the battery but it meant that all the earth blocks for
                the wiring were waving about in the breeze instead of being securely attached
                to anything metal. This was the cause of half the electrical bits not
                working correctly.
            <p/>
            <p>
                The discovery of so much rot came as a bit of a blow.
                I decided at this point that the car was not a viable restoration so I
                stripped out as much as I could that I considered useful, and sold what
                was left of the shell to somebody who wanted it for a new sill, the only
                bit of the car that was actually in a half decent condition.
            <p/>
            <p>
                As terrible as this car was, I had been bitten by the Porsche bug
                so I set about looking for another one. I kept an eye out on the
                online car sales websites and eventually found one that looked ideal.
                It involved a train ride to Bedford and I reasoned that taking the
                train would mean I could bring it back the same day. When I got to
                Bedford, the guy selling the car, met me at the station.
            </p>

                First appearances seemed quite promising. The paintwork seemed pretty good and the
                inside wasn't in too terrible a condition. The usual cracked dashboard and
                worn drivers seat but other than that it all seemed good. I took it for
                a test drive and decided that it was the one for me. Having negotiated
                the price down to what I considered to be reasonable, I parted with the
                cash and the car was mine. The drive down the M1 allowed me to get used
                to the car and it was then that I started to notice a few other things
                that weren't quite right. The temperature gauge wasn't working and the
                odometer also wasn't working. Apart from that it seemed relatively OK.
            </p>
            <p>
                It just so happened that when I bought the blue Porsche, my partner,
                Clare, was on holiday in Canada. This was lucky for me because she would
                have been less than impressed at my impulsive purchase. When she found
                out, she vowed to dislike the car but it only took one journey out in it
                to persuade her that it was an OK car and now she loves it to bits.
