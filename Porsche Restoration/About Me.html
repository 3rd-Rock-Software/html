            <p>
                I am 50 years old and currently working part time as a nurse in an operating theatre.<br><br>I have been working
                in the medical profession since I was 16 when I started as a volunteer with the red cross. My career has thus lasted
                for 34 years and as a result, I now feel it is time for a change. To that end, I am currently studying with the Open University
                and I am doing an IT degree. The purpose of this website is simply to practice HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been interested in cars so it made sense to me to write a webpage about car restoration.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my first attempt at HTML so it is likely to change a lot over time as I learn more.<br>
                It has been written entirely from scratch.
