<h2>
    Parts list
</h2>
<p>
    Some parts on Porsche 924's are compatible with other models from the VW
    range such as the T4 bus and Golf MK1. I will try to list them here as I
    discover what they are. If you know of any that I haven't listed, please
    email me.

<h4>
    Change water pipes
</h4>
<p>
    Removing the coolant pipes is simply a case of
    locating the relevant jubilee clips and loosening them.
    If the pipes are fairly old, it may be necessary to find a blunt
    object to loosen off the end of the rubber pipe from the connector.

<h4>
    Change water pump
</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>
    New timing belt
</h4>
<p>
    Changing the timing belt proved to be really easy.
    I had already removed all the radiator plumbing in order to change
    all the pipework for blue polyurethane pipes so I had lots of space
    at the front of the engine. It is easiest to do if the water pipes,
    timing belt cover and water pump are removed, all of which are
    fairly easy jobs.

<h4>
    Paint rocker box cover
</h4>

Loose wire
-->
<p>
    There is plenty to be done to it before it is at a standard that I would
    call good but it is over 30 years old and as such itï¿½s not going to be in
    mint condition.

<h4>
    Drivers door electric window not working
</h4>
<p>
    This actually turned out to be a really easy fix.<br>
    I removed the inner door lining and then removed the scissor lever for the window complete
    with motor. The motor is held on by 2 bolts and when I removed
    this I discovered the gear mechanism was full of water. A quick dry out and
    squirt of grease and everything was fixed.

<h4>

<h4>
    Sort out a few minor blemishes on the paintwork.
</h4>
<p>
    The paint generally is not in too bad a condition. The biggest issues are the bonnet and the N/S/F wing.<br>
    The paint comes off the bonnet every time I polish the car. I
    think this is because it has just been badly blown over and then not lacquered.<br>
    The N/S/F wing is entirely my own fault. I was lifting the car on a trolley jack to do some work under the engine.
    My intention was to put it on axle stands but I hadn't quite lifted it high enough.
    As I pumped the trolley jack higher, the car started to become a bit unstable, so I lowered the
    car quick before it fell off the trolley jack. This would have been a good idea if I had moved the axle stand out of the way.
    The end result was a very neat , square hole in the bottom of the wing. I removed the wing, filled the hole
    and resprayed the wing but I then ran out of paint. All this, 1 week before the big show at silverstone to celebrate 40 years of
    front engine porsche. At some point, I shall get round to taking the wing off and doing it properly.
