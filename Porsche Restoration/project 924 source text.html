    Parts list

<p>
    Some parts on Porsche 924's are compatible with other models from the VW
    range such as the T4 bus and Golf MK1. I will try to list them here as I
    discover what they are. If you know of any that I haven't listed, please
    email me.

    Restoration
</h2>

<p>
    My first venture into Porsche restoration arrived out of the blue in about March 2015.
</p>
<!--img src ""-->
<p>
    I knew someone who owned a red 924 which needed a good deal of love and
    attention. He needed to sell it to finance the purchase of another car and
    wondered if I fancied buying it.<br/>The car was in a terrible state. Half
    the interior had been ripped out and the bodywork was terrible.
</p>
<p>
    Without thinking twice, I discovered I had bought it.<br>I�ve always been
    a bit prone to making decisions without really thinking them through.!!
</p>
<p>
    I eventually managed to find the time to have a look at it and decide what
    the important jobs were. I figured that as half the
    electrics didn�t work, I would try to trace some of those faults first.
    I started by stripping out the interior so that I would have better
    access to the wiring. Out came the seats and dashboard. It was at this
    moment that I got my next surprise. At some point in it�s life the car
    had obviously suffered from a lot of rot�� and none of it had been fixed.
    The battery tray had rotted away and instead of cutting out all the dead
    tin and fixing it, somebody had just welded a plate in over the top.
    This was fine for the battery but it meant that all the earth blocks for
    the wiring were waving about in the breeze instead of being securely attached
    to anything metal. This was the cause of half the electrical bits not
    working correctly.
<p/>
<p>
    The discovery of so much rot came as a bit of a blow.
    I decided at this point that the car was not a viable restoration so I
    stripped out as much as I could that I considered useful, and sold what
    was left of the shell to somebody who wanted it for a new sill, the only
    bit of the car that was actually in a half decent condition.
<p/>
<p>
    As terrible as this car was, I had been bitten by the Porsche bug
    so I set about looking for another one. I kept an eye out on the
    online car sales websites and eventually found one that looked ideal.
    It involved a train ride to Bedford and I reasoned that taking the
    train would mean I could bring it back the same day. When I got to
    Bedford, the guy selling the car, met me at the station.
</p>
<p>
    First appearances seemed quite promising. The paintwork seemed pretty good and the
    inside wasn�t in too terrible a condition. The usual cracked dashboard and
    worn drivers seat but other than that it all seemed good. I took it for
    a test drive and decided that it was the one for me. Having negotiated
    the price down to what I considered to be reasonable, I parted with the
    cash and the car was mine. The drive down the M1 allowed me to get used
    to the car and it was then that I started to notice a few other things
    that weren�t quite right. The temperature gauge wasn�t working and the
    odometer also wasn�t working. Apart from that it seemed relatively OK.
</p>
<p>
    It just so happened that when I bought the blue Porsche, my partner,
    Clare, was on holiday in Canada. This was lucky for me because she would
    have been less than impressed at my impulsive purchase. When she found
    out, she vowed to dislike the car but it only took one journey out in it
    to persuade her that it was an OK car and now she loves it to bits.

    Jobs done
</h2>
<h4>
    Steering wheel
</h4>
<p>
    I decided to change the standard steering wheel for a removal racing wheel.
    The reason for this was that the original wheel didn't leave room for my
    knees and felt huge. I bought a 300mm steering wheel from Ebay. To go with
    it, I bought a removable boss kit to allow the wheel to fit on the spline.
</p>
<h3>problems....</h3>
<h4>wiring</h4>
<p>The new steering wheel came with a separate horn button. It had 2 wires
    coming from it. To start with this confused me as the old steering wheel
    only had 1 wire. When I wired up the horn with both wires, the horn worked
    as soon as I tried to attach the steering wheel to the boss. This meant that
    it was shorting out through the boss. Eventually I discovered that only one
    wire was needed as the horn earthed through the steering column spline.
    Problem solved. I just chopped off one wire.</p>
<h4>
    lining up the wheel to get it straight.
</h4>
<p>
    When I attached the steering wheel it fitted perfectly except that it wasn't
    on straight. There were only six holes on the centre boss, moving the steering
    wheel round to the next hole meant that the steering wheel was out of
    alignment in the other direction. I had to use much trial and error by
    aligning the boss on the steering column. It took 3 or 4 goes before I got
    the steering wheel straight.
</p>
<h4>
    Change water pipes
</h4>
<p>
    Removing the coolant pipes is simply a case of
    locating the relevant jubilee clips and loosening them.
    If the pipes are fairly old, it may be necessary to find a blunt
    object to loosen off the end of the rubber pipe from the connector.
</p>
<h4>
    Change water pump
</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>
    New timing belt
</h4>
<p>
    Changing the timing belt proved to be really easy.
    I had already removed all the radiator plumbing in order to change
    all the pipework for blue polyurethane pipes so I had lots of space
    at the front of the engine. It is easiest to do if the water pipes,
    timing belt cover and water pump are removed, all of which are
    fairly easy jobs.
</p>
<h4>
    Paint rocker box cover
</h4>

<!--
Loose wire
-->
<p>
    There is plenty to be done to it before it is at a standard that I would
    call good but it is over 30 years old and as such it�s not going to be in
    mint condition.
</p>
<h4>
    Drivers door electric window not working
</h4>
<p>
    This actually turned out to be a really easy fix.<br>
    I removed the inner door lining and then removed the scissor lever for the window complete
    with motor. The motor is held on by 2 bolts and when I removed
    this I discovered the gear mechanism was full of water. A quick dry out and
    squirt of grease and everything was fixed.

<h4>
    Replace the speedo

<h4>
    Re-upholster the seats

<p></p>
<h4>
    Replace the carpet.

<h4>
    Sort out a few minor blemishes on the paintwork.
</h4>
<p>
    The paint generally is not in too bad a condition. The biggest issues are the bonnet and the N/S/F wing.<br>
    The paint comes off the bonnet every time I polish the car. I
    think this is because it has just been badly blown over and then not lacquered.<br>
    The N/S/F wing is entirely my own fault. I was lifting the car on a trolley jack to do some work under the engine.
    My intention was to put it on axle stands but I hadn't quite lifted it high enough.
    As I pumped the trolley jack higher, the car started to become a bit unstable, so I lowered the
    car quick before it fell off the trolley jack. This would have been a good idea if I had moved the axle stand out of the way.
    The end result was a very neat , square hole in the bottom of the wing. I removed the wing, filled the hole
    and resprayed the wing but I then ran out of paint. All this, 1 week before the big show at silverstone to celebrate 40 years of
    front engine porsche. At some point, I shall get round to taking the wing off and doing it properly.
