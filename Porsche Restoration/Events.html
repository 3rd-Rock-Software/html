            <p>
                The <a href ="https://london.acecafe.com/" target="_blank">Ace Cafe</a> opened in 1938 as a roadside cafe to cater for people using
                the new A406 north circular road. Due to its location close to the main roads heading in and out of London, it became
                popular as a truck stop and a meeting place for motorists to share a cup of tea and proper British breakfast.
                In 1940 it was mostly destroyed by an air raid and for a while it had a temporary home in a wooden shed.
                The cafe was rebuilt in 1948 and after it re-opened in 1949, it went on to attract motorbikes and rockers until 1969
                when it closed. The building has seen use as cafe, petrol station, bookmakers and a tyre depot.
                In 1994 it was re-opened after Mark Wilsmore formed the Ace Cafe Re-union to mark the 25th anniversary of the cafe's
                closure.
            </p>
            The <a href="https://porsche924.co.uk/" target="_blank">Porsche 924 owners club</a> hold their first annual meet of the year at the Ace.
